1. Why doesn't the integer change after the method call?
      //The integer doesn't change after the method call because of variable scope. The variable's scope was limited to the for loop,
      //therefore the integer didn't change after the method was simply called by itself.
3. Why does the array change after the method call?
      The array changes after the method call because it is being directly interacted with and not as a copy.
5. What happens when you try to access y outside the loop?
      There is an error because Y is a local variable confined to the method and its for loop.
